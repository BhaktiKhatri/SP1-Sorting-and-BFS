Steps to run the program:
1.Create a project and copy all the java programs below to eclipse.
		a. For merge sort on generic array : MergeSortUsingGenerics.java 
		b. For merge sort on int array : MergeSUsingIntArray.java
		c. O(N^2) sort on int array(Insertion sort) : InsertionSort.java
		d. Driver program : Driver.java	
		e. Timer program to know the run time : Timer.java
2. save the script file(q1_script.sh) in the bin folder of the java project.
	Details about script file.
	a. Script file is responsible for running the driver program.
	b. Stop any sort program if it runs more than 2 minutes.
	c. In q1_script.sh file, 1: used for MergeSortUsingGenerics
				 2: used for InsertionSort
				 3: used for MergeSUsingIntArray 
3. Save the input file(input.txt) in the same project folder.
4. To run the driver program and save the output in a file, run the below command in bash terminal (MAC & Linux supported only) :
	./q1_script.sh &> output.txt  
	output.txt : is the output file where the output of driver program will be saved.
